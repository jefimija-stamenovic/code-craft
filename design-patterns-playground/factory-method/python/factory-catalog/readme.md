# 🏭 System for generating catalog of products by producer

This repository represents catalog generation system, where different manufacturers
(brands) produce different types of products. 
For example: 
 - Apple → produces phones, laptop, PCs
 - Samsung → produces phones, TVs, washing machines 
 - Sony → produces TVs, consoles, cameras

Client doesn't need to know details of how each product is created - they simple select the manufacturer and receive the corresponding product
